# Experiments for the paper "Multi-target detection with application to cryo-electron microscopy" by Tamir Bendory, Nicolas Boumal, William Leeb, Eitan Levin and Amit Singer

Figures for numerical experiments in the paper are obtained by running

XP1_heterogeneous_K_L_phase_transitions.m : the three plots with L on the x-axis and L on the y-axis
XP2_heterogeneous_progressive.m : the plots with relative RMSE evolutions as a function of observation length

Both scripts take a long time to run (a few days running on a computer with ~50 CPUs working in parallel.)

Manopt needs to be available in the Matlab environemnt (download here: https://www.manopt.org, and add to path following the installation instructions.)
